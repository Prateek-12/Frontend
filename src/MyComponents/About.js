         Flight
        services in the United States As of 2005, the FAA federal contractor for
        their flight service function throughout the continental U.S., Hawaii
        and the Caribbean was Lockheed Martin (LMFS).[4] Leidos has taken over
        as of 17 August 2016, following a merger with Lockheed Martin
        Information Systems & Global Solutions Business.[5] (AFSS used to refer
        to the Automated Flight Service Station. ) The FAA still oversees flight
        service in Alaska. At this time Leidos operates two large hub
        facilities. Flight service duties and responsibilities are divided into
        preflight, inflight and flight data.[6] They also monitor the HIWAS and
        TIBS recorded weather briefings, which pilots can access via radio or
        phone. The services are provided at no charge to the flying public.
        Preflight – Primarily responsible for filing flight plans, giving
        preflight weather briefings, and providing information concerning air
        traffic, they also take information from pilots coming into the US to
        notify the United States Customs Service that an aircraft is inbound.
        The Leidos call tree has the ability to route calls to any flight
        service facility in the country.[7] Inflight – which the pilots call
        “Radio”, activates, cancels, and alters VFR flight plans. They take
        position reports and changes of destination for both civilian and
        military aircraft. They relay IFR and SVFR clearances to aircraft on the
        ground either by phone or through their frequencies when there is no
        direct method of communication with the air traffic control facility
        governing the area. At border stations, Radio also takes information
        from aircraft crossing into the U.S., and issues squawk codes to VFR
        aircraft which identify them to Homeland Security's radar. They relay
        information on forest fires to the U.S. Forest Service. Inflight
        monitors VHF and UHF frequencies, VOR voices, and emergency frequencies
        – from 60 to 100 different frequencies per area. The United States FSS
        radio frequencies are published in several FAA publications, including
        airport facility directories (AFD), VFR sectional maps, and IFR low and
        high altitude en route charts. When pilots have an inflight emergency,
        such as being lost, having smoke in the cockpit, or having low fuel and
        needing directions to the nearest airport with fuel, they call flight
        service for assistance. Radio can take flight plans and give pre-flight
        briefings over the radio in extenuating circumstances.[8] Leidos until
        early 2016 had another inflight position called Flight Watch, which was
        dedicated to updating weather for aircraft en route. Radio now performs
        that function. Enroute Flight Advisory Service (EFAS) or Flight Watch
        was designed to give pilots who are already airborne updates on weather
        during their current flight, and take pilots' reports or PIREPS, which
        they enter into the computer for transmission to the National Weather
        Service.[9] The Flight Data position in flight service is an
        informational clearinghouse that pilots seldom speak to unless they are
        calling for an IFR clearance by telephone. Flight Data is responsible
        for coordination with other air traffic facilities, U.S Customs and
        Homeland security, the Fire Service, military baseops, airport managers
        and law enforcement. Search and rescue activities are initiated at
        Flight Data when VFR aircraft become overdue. Weather observers and
        airport tower operators call them to input weather observations or pilot
        reports to the National Weather Service. LMFS added an option for pilots
        in 2013 called Surveillance Enhanced Search and Rescue, SE-SAR,[10]
        which allows them to keep track of en route aircraft via satellite.
        Flight Data issues some types of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) through the
        FAA's E-Notam II computer system.[11
