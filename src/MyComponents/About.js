        The airline was set up under the <b>Air Corporations Act </b>, 1953 with
        an initial capital of Indian Rupee symbol.svg 32 million and started
        operations on 1 August 1953. It was established after legislation came
        into force to nationalise the entire airline industry in India. Two new
        national airlines were to be formed along the same lines as happened in
        the United Kingdom with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and
        British European Airways (BEA). Air India took over international routes
        and Indian Airlines Corporation (IAC) took over the domestic and
        regional routes. Eight pre-Independence domestic airlines, Deccan
        Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Kalinga
        Airlines, Indian National Airways and Air Services of India and the
        Domestic wing of Air India, were merged to form the new domestic
        national carrier Indian Airlines Corporation. International operations
        of Air India Ltd. was taken over by the newly formed Air India
        International. Indian Airlines Corporation inherited a fleet of 99
        aircraft including 74 Douglas DC-3 Dakotas, 12 Vickers Vikings, 3
        Douglas DC-4s and various smaller types from the seven airlines that
        made it up. The aircraft livery used while the company was called Indian
        Airlines was one of the longest in continuous use in the airline
        industry. The logo (IA) and the livery were designed by National
        Institute of Design Ahmedabad. Its aircraft were mainly white, with the
        belly painted in light metallic grey. Above the windows, "Indian
        Airlines" was written in English on the starboard side and in Hindi on
        port side. The tail was bright orange, with its logo in white. In most
        of the aircraft, the logo was also painted on the engines over its bare
        metal colour. Also, when the company was under the title of Indian
        Airlines, to celebrate its 50th year of service the airline put the
        slogan "50 years of flying" in gold on many of their aircraft. After the
        name change to Indian, the company's aircraft sported a new look
        inspired by the Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha. The tail of their
        aircraft had a partial blue wheel since practically 3/4 of the remainder
        is cut off. The wheel is over an orange background with the carrier's
        name "Indian" written in English on one side of the fuselage, and in
        Hindi on the other. On 15 May 2007, the Government of India released the
        new merger livery, which was sent to Boeing in Seattle to repaint all
        the new fleet coming into the new Air India. Most of the old fleets of
        Air India and Indian Airlines have also been painted in the new
        livery.[13]
